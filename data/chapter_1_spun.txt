The sun beat down upon the island of Karolin, its radiant warmth illuminating the vibrant turquoise waters of the lagoon. The air was alive with the sounds of laughter and children playing on the beach, their tiny hands grasping for seashells and shells. Amidst this idyllic scene, a lone figure stood atop a coral ledge, his gaze fixed intently upon the horizon.

Dick, a man with a mysterious past, gazed out at the seemingly endless expanse of water, his eyes squinting against the glare of the sun. Behind him, the thunderous roar of the outer sea crashed against the shore, while before him lay the tranquil lagoon, its surface adorned with fishing gulls soaring overhead.

As he stood there, lost in thought, a small figure appeared beside him – Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker. The child's eyes shone with curiosity as he asked his question, "Taori, who are you?" Dick's mind wandered back to the distant past, where the memory of Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, began to resurface.

But how could he explain it all – the strange boat that brought him here, the girl Katafa who had been blown away from this very island years ago? The stories of his past were shrouded in a misty haze, and even Dick himself was unsure of what lay beyond the luminous veil that hid his memories.

As he pondered these questions, a sudden cry pierced the air – "Ai, the fish!" Little Tari's fascination with the commotion on the beach drew him away, leaving Dick to continue his introspection. His gaze drifted back to the north, where the distant outline of Palm Tree began to take shape.

The memory of the men who had taken possession of that island, of Katafa and himself escaping in a dinghy as the Melanesian hands rose up to destroy their home, flooded his mind. The threat they posed was not immediate, but Dick knew it would come – the men would build canoes and seek out Karolin, drawn by the lure of its women.

As he stood there, lost in thought, Katafa appeared beside him, her dark hair blowing back on the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her eyes, luminous and dark, gazed out at the sea line where Palm Tree was beginning to take shape once more.

"Look!" she whispered, her hand resting upon his shoulder. Together, they stood transfixed as the island rose from the mirage, its beauty blurring with their memories of the past. The scene unfolded before them – the figures of savages on the beach, the wind filling the sail as they fled in a dinghy, and the yells of the Melanesians mad with rum.

As Dick gazed upon this vision, his nostrils expanded and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him – nothing – but they had threatened Katafa – everything – and they still did.

In that moment, as the island faded from view once more, a sense of foreboding settled over him. The threat was not just to the north; it lay wherever greed or desire or hatred might roam on that azure sea. It was a world beyond their own, where men's instincts for war and destruction drove them forward.

And yet, even amidst this darkness, there was a glimmer of hope – the foundation of all history, man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.
